scaling_algorithms:

  linear_progression:
    name: "Linear Progression"
    description: "Steady linear increase in difficulty"
    formula: "base_value + (level * increment)"
    parameters:
      increment: 0.1
    use_cases: ["beginner_challenges", "consistency_challenges"]

  exponential_progression:
    name: "Exponential Growth"
    description: "Exponential difficulty increase"
    formula: "base_value * (multiplier ^ level)"
    parameters:
      multiplier: 1.15
    use_cases: ["strength_challenges", "advanced_challenges"]

  logarithmic_progression:
    name: "Logarithmic Scaling"
    description: "Slower growth at higher levels"
    formula: "base_value * log(level + 1) * factor"

      factor: 1.5
    use_cases: ["endurance_challenges", "skill_challenges"]

difficulty_multipliers:
  user_performance_based:
    high_performer: 1.25      # >80% completion rate
    average_performer: 1.0    # 50-80% completion rate
    struggling_user: 0.8      # <50% completion rate

  journey_phase_based:
    foundation: 0.9
    building: 1.0
    mastery: 1.3

  challenge_type_based:
    DAILY: 0.8
    WEEKLY: 1.0
    MONTHLY: 1.5

adaptive_scaling:
  completion_rate_targets:
    optimal_range: [60, 80]  # Target 60-80% completion rate
    adjustment_threshold: 10  # Adjust if outside range by 10%
    adjustment_factor: 0.1    # 10% adjustment per iteration

  performance_windows:
    recent_challenges: 10     # Look at last 10 challenges
    performance_history: 30   # 30-day performance window

  scaling_limits:
    maximum_increase: 2.0     # Max 2x base difficulty
    minimum_decrease: 0.5     # Min 0.5x base difficulty
    adjustment_frequency: 7   # Adjust weekly
